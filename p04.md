In which Foucault describes a painting for more than ten pages straight!

We traverse the subjects of this painting in order to broach the matter of “subject-ness” overall- this is Foucault’s real project in The Order of Things. How have we come to see ourselves as subjects in ways we may not have in past history?

The way Velasquez has framed this scene, we the viewers stand in the position of the unseen subject being painted. Only in the distant mirror do we catch a glimpse- oh wait, we’re the Sovereigns themselves! **Or are we?** 

The mirror’s at a strange angle, the more you zoom in on details, all the perspective is slightly warped, resulting in “an oscillation between the interior and the exterior”, like a quantum see-saw of subjectivity - to Foucault, this painting illuminates the unique elements and space of representation in the prior Classical age (Foucault, 1970, p. 11)

*TODO* No meme needed bc I will turn the Las Meninas painting itself into a meme, a la the mockup below]
