The following are culled from basic Google search, especially tailored to the confines of the reddit.com/imgur.com ecosystem.

I have created none of the following images, and their provenance + copyright is as dubious as is to be expected in the memelord tradition. Please contact me at [this handle](mailto:ms.chelsea.palmer@gmail.com) to request takedown of any of these memes for copyright purposes.

Note: I'm attempting "broad strokes summary" in the alt-text of these commons memes for accessibility purposes- the image filename is derived from the source, and usually contains the best related search terms.
