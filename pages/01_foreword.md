| With this **archaeology** he wasn't trying to <br> trace backwards from the present to find longitudinal causation. <br> Instead, he was interested in zooming in on history's timeline from a bird's eye view <br> to identify apparent **disruptions in power and knowledge at the event level**. | ![middle ages meme](../memes/middleages.jpg) |
