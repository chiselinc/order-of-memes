| Foucault explains the ambitious project of this text: <br> <br> to produce a cross-section of different disciplines <br> <br> which **massively shifted** at certain periods of time. | ![Foucault foreword](../memes/foucault_foreword.png) <br> *Original art sourced from* [thierry ehrmann on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/home_of_chaos/2550922632), [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) |
| With this **archaeology** he wasn't trying to <br> trace backwards from the present <br> to find longitudinal causation. <br> Instead, he was interested in <br> zooming in on history's timeline <br> from a bird's eye view <br> to identify apparent **disruptions** <br> in **power** and **knowledge** <br> at the **level of events**. | ![middle ages meme](../memes/middleages.jpg) |
| Foucault claims his goal <br> “is to reveal a [*positive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom#Positive_and_negative) <br> [**unconscious**](https://www.lacanonline.com/2017/04/whats-so-unconscious-about-the-unconscious/) of knowledge.” (Foucault, 1970, p. xi) <br> In other words, <br> *What’s omnipresent in science*, <br> [*but no scientists can see?*](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water) | ![spiderman what is water](../memes/whatiswaterspiderman.png) |
