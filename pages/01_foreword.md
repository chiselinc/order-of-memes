# Foreword

|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| “This foreword should perhaps  be headed ‘Directions for Use.’”  (Foucault, 1970, p. ix) Foucault explains the ambitious project of this text: to produce a cross-section of different disciplines which massively shifted at certain periods of time. | ![middle ages meme](../memes/middleages.jpg) |
| With this **archaeology** he wasn't trying to trace backwards from the present to find longitudinal causation. | Instead, he was interested in zooming in from a bird's eye timeline view to identify apparent **disruptions at the event level**. |

| He claims his goal “is to reveal a [*positive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom#Positive_and_negative) [**unconscious**](https://www.lacanonline.com/2017/04/whats-so-unconscious-about-the-unconscious/) of knowledge” (Foucault, 1970, p. xi) | In other words, [What’s omnipresent in science, but no scientists can see?](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water) |
