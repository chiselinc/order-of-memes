“*General grammar is the study of verbal order in its relation to the simultaneity that it is its task to represent*. Its proper object is therefore neither thought nor any individual language, but *discourse*, understood as a sequence of verbal signs.” (Foucault, 1970, p. 83)

This dimension of language, which rigorously structures the backbone *within* each given language but varies widely in its norms and conventions *between* languages, that starts to formalize into “science” terms the unwieldy and chaotic generative creativity of communication itself [*this last part is me editorializing slightly, perhaps?*]

“Language gives the perpetual disruption of time the continuity of space, and it is to the degree that it analyses, articulates, and patterns representation that it has the power to link our knowledge of things together across the dimension of time. With the advent of language, the chaotic monotony of space is fragmented, while at the same time the diversity of temporal successions is unified.” (Foucault, 1970, p. 113) *TODO* incorporate this into a meme/visual
