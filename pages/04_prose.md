Now that Foucault’s chattered about laughter, and described a painting at length, he’s comfortable getting down to brass taxes. He wants to bring us deep into a historical period, and finally start to broach some specific theses:

Representation throughout the Renaissance period was all about similitude- even in contrast, signs were still mostly “representing” their relationships to one another.

We started inevitably to bump up against “The Limits of the World” (Foucault, 1970, p. 31), and of the world it created. It made every navigation of knowledge an interpretation of seemingly opaque signs, which anchored literal magic alongside education, or what the English translation of "The Order of Things" repeatedly deems [“erudition”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erudition).

In the heritage of antiquity, *divinatio* ("making nature speak") and *eruditio* (“restoring sleeping language to life”) are two sides of the same coin... Thus, all manners of explaining the world held approxiately the same legitimacy within their appropriate context.
