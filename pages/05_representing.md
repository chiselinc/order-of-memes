# Representing

| “Because the mind analyses, the sign appears. Because the mind [has signs at its disposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signified_and_signifier), analysis never ceases” (Foucault, 1970, p. 61). | 'Making sense' gains a longitudinal and more systemic dimension leading onward from the Classical age. Instead of always 'drawing things together' from face value, we begin to *discriminate* based upon rudimentary frameworks of order- *pure analogy* gives way to *gradual analysis* (Foucault, 1970, p. 55). |
| In other words, representation and interpretation moves beyond a flat field of signs, and starts to incorporate rulesets and action. | Signs stop living in the physical world alone, and enter our minds as representative triggers for knowledge and discernment. |

| We can think of this 'next level' of language, in which it becomes formalized and requires a more participatory social layer, to parallel software code. | It is both a set of instructions, and the means by which to execute those instructions. **Tilting at windmills!** |
