| “Because the mind analyses, the sign appears. <br> <br> Because the mind [has signs at its disposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signified_and_signifier), <br> <br> analysis never ceases” (Foucault, 1970, p. 61). | ![Don Quixote meme](../memes/donquixotememe3.png) | 
|'Making sense' gains a longitudinal <br> <br> and more systemic dimension <br> <br> leading onward from the Classical age. | ![Don Quixote meme](../memes/donquixotememe1.jpg) | 
|Instead of always 'drawing things together' from face value, <br> <br> we begin to *discriminate* based upon rudimentary frameworks of order- <br> <br> **pure analogy** gives way to **gradual analysis**. | ![Don Quixote meme](../memes/donquixotememe4.jpg) |
| In other words, <br> <br> **representation** and **interpretation** <br> <br> move beyond a flat field of signs, <br> <br> and start incorporating **rulesets** and **action**. <br> <br> Signs stop living in the physical world alone, <br> <br> *entering our minds* <br> to reside there <br> <br> as representative triggers <br> for **knowledge** and **discernment**. | ![Don Quixote meme](../memes/donquixotememe5.png) |
| We can think of this <br> 'next level' of language <br> <br> as formalizing *action* in writing, <br> <br> parallel to software code: <br> <br> It is both a set of instructions, <br> <br> and the means by which <br> those instructions are executed. <br> <br> **Tilting at windmills!** | ![Don Quixote meme](../memes/donquixotememe2.png) |
