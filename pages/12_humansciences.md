|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| Where Classical thinkers <br> interpreted opaque signs of the earth, <br> Modern thinkers began to impose <br> socially constructed layers of meaning over everything. | ![humans on earth](../memes/humansearth.jpg) |
| Modern thinkers carved out new discourses, <br> which Foucault termed "the human sciences", <br> in which they were, in a sense, <br> primarily studying their newly constructed "selves" <br> projected onto the face of the world, <br> influencing and perpetuating subtly biased taxonomic frameworks. | ![wise in the ways of science](../memes/wiseinthewaysofscience.png) |
| Our clever discourses trick us into thinking <br> Modern humans were clever enough to detect <br> hidden truths that were there throughout time. <br> <br> Instead, Foucault suggests these Modern "truths" <br> are projected narratives persisting throughout <br> relatively recent, but still well-established, <br> systems of power and knowledge. | ![trolley meme](../memes/trollymeme.png) |
