# Classifying

|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
|In the Classical Age, attempts to establish <br> <br> a sense of ordered classes of “character” <br> <br> from the visible elements of the natural world <br> <br> lead humans beyond just *drawing things together* <br> <br> and well into the realm of *discriminating between things* <br> <br> based on pre-existing frameworks. <br> <br> **Rudimentary** frameworks at this stage, but still. | ![like this bookshelf](../memes/bookshelf.jpg) |
| Foucault uses the incremental journey towards *biological taxonomy* <br> <br> as one of many examples of this shift: <br> <br> [Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae) introduced a system which was arbitrary and relative, <br> <br> but became the skeleton to an increasingly universalized <br> <br> and extensible framework for categorizing known life forms. | ![Chess be like](../memes/chessbelike.jpg)  |
| [Lamarck](http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/People/lamarck.html#:~:text=Lamarck%2C%20studying%20Linnaeus's%20system,largely%20the%20work%20of%20Lamarck) took this further, providing the transition point <br> <br> where Darwin would later pivot into full modernist disruption. | ![Classifying memes](../memes/naturalhistorytaxonomymeme.jpg) |
