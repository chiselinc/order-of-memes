# The Limits of Representation

| Words | Pictures |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| Here's where Foucault shifts gears <br> from topical deep-diving <br> to orient his larger archaeological investigation. <br> <br> We return to a concept he first broached <br> in "The Prose of the World" <br> - **limits**. | ![limits to understanding](../memes/limitsunderstanding.jpg) |
| In the Renaissance, he focused on <br> the structural limits of representation <br> for its subjects. <br> <br> As we move through investigating <br> the shifts of the Classical Age, <br> and into the Modern, <br> we encounter a different type of limit: <br> the self-conscious limits of systems <br> which humans have co-created <br> to lend frames of order to the chaotic world, <br> and to better understand themselves. | ![mixed memes](../memes/mixedmemes.png) |
| For at last, we started to have <br> "selves" to understand! <br> <br> Even if, along the way to fashioning our "selves" <br> <br> we were doomed to see our own limits in them... | ![Kant Woke](../memes/kantwoke.jpg) |
