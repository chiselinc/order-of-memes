# Speaking

|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| Foucault points out how the increasing formalization of order <br> within individual fields of study enabled new types of analysis, <br> moving from comparative to abstract universal reflection: | “*General grammar is the study of verbal order in its relation to the simultaneity that it is its task to represent*. <br> Its proper object is therefore neither thought nor any individual language, <br> but *discourse*, understood as a sequence of verbal signs.” (Foucault, 1970, p. 83) |
| In other words, though our contemporary society assumes that "discourse" has always been in existence, <br> humans have only been self-reflexively aware of it for a relatively short period of time. <br> For thousands of years before that, we were just... talking. | ![allowing for jokes like these](../memes/verbmeme.jpg) |
| **Discursive norms**, which rigorously structure the backbone *within* each given language but vary widely *between* languages, <br>  started to formalize the unwieldy chaos of spoken words into a recognizable "science", <br> and granted the possibility of situating “histories” of language and its use. | ![grammar](../memes/grammarmeme.jpg) |
