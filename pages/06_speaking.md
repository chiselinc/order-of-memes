| Foucault points out how <br> <br> the increasing formalization of order <br> <br> within individual fields of study <br> <br> enabled new types of analysis, <br> <br> moving from comparative <br> <br> to abstract universal reflection:  <br> <br> “*General grammar is the study*  <br> <br> *of verbal order in its* <br> <br> *relation to the simultaneity* <br> <br> *that it is its task to represent*. <br> <br> Its proper object is therefore <br> <br> neither thought nor any individual language, <br> <br> but *discourse*, understood as <br> <br> a sequence of verbal signs.” <br> (Foucault, 1970, p. 83) | ![grammar](../memes/languagesmeme.jpg) |
| In other words, though our contemporary society assumes <br> <br> that "discourse" has always been in existence, <br> <br> humans have only been self-reflexively aware of it <br> <br> for a relatively short period of time. <br> <br> For thousands of years before that, <br> <br> we were just... talking. | ![allowing for jokes like these](../memes/verbmeme.jpg) |
| **Discursive norms**, which rigorously structure <br> <br> the backbone *within* each given language <br> <br> but vary widely *between* languages, <br> <br>  started to formalize the unwieldy chaos <br> <br> of spoken words into a recognizable "science", <br> <br> and granted the possibility <br> <br> of situating “histories” <br> <br> of language and its use. | ![grammar](../memes/grammarmeme.jpg) |
