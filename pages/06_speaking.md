# Speaking

|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| Foucault points out how the increasing formalization of order within individual fields of study enabled new types of analysis, moving from comparative to abstract universal reflection: | “*General grammar is the study of verbal order in its relation to the simultaneity that it is its task to represent*. Its proper object is therefore neither thought nor any individual language, but *discourse*, understood as a sequence of verbal signs.” (Foucault, 1970, p. 83) |
| In other words, where we'd take for granted that "discourse" has always been in existence, humans have only been self-reflexively aware of it for a relatively short period of time. | ![allowing for jokes like these](../memes/verbmeme.jpg) |
| **Discursive norms**, which rigorously structure the backbone *within* each given language but vary widely *between* languages, started to formalize the unwieldy chaos of spoken words into a recognizable "science", and granting the possibility of situating “histories” of language and its use. | ![grammar](../memes/languagesmeme.jpg)  |
