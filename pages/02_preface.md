# Preface

|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| This book happened because [Borges made Foucault laugh out loud](https://www.thendobetter.com/arts/2019/7/27/messy-borges-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) | ![wilkins.jpg](../memes/wilkins.png) Public domain, retrieved from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wilkins_An_Essay_towards_a_real.jpg) |
| In order to mock a philosopher’s proposal for a “universal language,” [Borges described an imaginary archaic encyclopedia, supposedly Chinese in origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Knowledge) which highlights the arbitrary nature of taxonomy itself. | And again, this made Foucault laugh, and then think, and then write a 400 page book. |
