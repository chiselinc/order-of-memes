# Man and His Doubles

| Words | Pictures |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| Here's where Foucault really gets into his element, <br> wading into both philosophy as a practice <br> and the broader philosophical implications <br> of all he's discussed to this point. | ![gaze into the abyss](../memes/gazeabyss.jpg) |
| He points towards the cascading <br> inward spiral of reflexive thought, <br> the series of "doubles" created within human reflection <br> by making "Man" increasingly the object of human thought. | ![Being and Time and Being a Human](../memes/humanbeing.png) |
| One can only wonder <br> what Foucault might have thought about <br> the viciously self-referential nihilistic trends <br> of modern meme culture. | ![modern philosophical discourse](../memes/modernphilosophy.jpg) |
