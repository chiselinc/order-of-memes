“This foreword should perhaps be headed ‘Directions for Use.’” (Foucault, 1970, p. ix)

Foucault explains the ambitious project of this text: he seeks to produce a cross-section of different disciplines which massively shifted at certain periods of time, and trace whether those might all be anchored in the shift of norms of knowledge production itself.

Foucault sought not to trace back longitudinal causation but rather noticeable disruption.

He claims his goal “is to reveal a [positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom#Positive_and_negative) [unconscious](https://www.lacanonline.com/2017/04/whats-so-unconscious-about-the-unconscious/) of knowledge” (Foucault, 1970, p. xi)
