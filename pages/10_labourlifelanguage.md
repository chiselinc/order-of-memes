# Labour, Life, Language

| Words | Pictures |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| "Labour," "Life," and "Language" cover the broad realm <br> where Foucault locates the focus <br> of the empirical sciences. <br> <br> Here he returns to many of the topics <br> he covered in-depth earlier in the book, <br> and positions them more explicitly <br> in terms of the disruptive thinkers in each field which led us towards, in Foucault's eyes, the "creation of Man" and the birth of the Modern episteme. | ![conceptualizing time](../memes/marxtime.jpg) |
