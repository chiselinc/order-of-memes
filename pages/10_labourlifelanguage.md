# Labour, Life, Language

| Words | Pictures |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| "Labour," "Life," and "Language" cover the broad realm <br> where Foucault locates the focus <br> of the empirical sciences, <br> and he addresses many specific figures <br> who were pivotal to disrupting the Classical episteme. | ![conceptualizing time](../memes/marxtime.jpg) |
| Here he returns to many of the topics <br> he covered in-depth earlier in the book, <br> and positions them more explicitly <br> in terms of the "creation of Man" <br> and the birth of the Modern episteme.  | ![I don't know](../memes/dontknow.jpg) |
| Here is where we begin to plumb the depths <br> of the unconscious mind, and make space <br> for purposeful and even generative juxtapositions. | ![I think they're neat](../memes/naturalhistorymeme.jpg) |
