| In which Foucault describes a painting... <br> <br> **for more than ten pages straight!** <br> <br> We traverse the subjects of this painting <br> in order to broach the matter <br> of “subject-ness” overall- <br> **this is Foucault’s real project** <br> **in The Order of Things**. <br> <br> How have we come to see ourselves <br> as *subjects* <br> in ways we may not have <br> in earlier history? | ![The painting - Las Meninas](../memes/lasmeninas_small.jpg) [The painting - Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Meninas) <br> *Scroll to the bottom of the page <br> for a closer look* |
| The way Velázquez has framed this scene, we the viewers <br> stand in the position of <br> the unseen subject being painted. <br> <br> Only in the distant mirror <br> do we catch a glimpse- <br> oh wait, we’re the Sovereigns themselves! <br> <br> **Or are we?** | ![a much later form of conceptual representation](../memes/wasteoftime.png) |
| The mirror’s at a strange angle; <br> the more you zoom in on details, <br> all the perspective is  <br> slightly warped, resulting in <br> “an oscillation between <br> the interior and the exterior”, <br> like a quantum see-saw of subjectivity <br> (Foucault, 1970, p. 11). <br> <br>  To Foucault, this painting illuminates <br> the unique space of representation <br> in the episteme of the Classical Age: <br>  most of all, the viewers' <br> blissful invisibility to themselves. | ![paint a picture](../memes/paintapicture.jpg) |
