# Las Meninas

|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| In which Foucault describes a painting... <br> for more than ten pages straight! | ![The painting - Las Meninas](../memes/lasmeninas_small.jpg) [The painting - Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Meninas) |
| We traverse the subjects of this painting <br> in order to broach the matter of “subject-ness” overall- <br> **this is Foucault’s real project in The Order of Things**. | How have we come to see ourselves <br> as *subjects* <br> in ways we may not have in earlier history? |
| The way Velázquez has framed this scene, we the viewers <br> stand in the position of <br> the unseen subject being painted. | Only in the distant mirror do we catch a glimpse- <br> oh wait, we’re the Sovereigns themselves! <br> **Or are we?** |
| The mirror’s at a strange angle, the more you zoom in on details, all the perspective is slightly warped, resulting in “an oscillation between the interior and the exterior”, like a quantum see-saw of subjectivity (Foucault, 1970, p. 11). | To Foucault, this painting illuminates the unique elements and space of representation in the episteme of the Classical Age - most of all, the viewers' blissful invisibility to themselves. |
