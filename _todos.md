* [for speaking.md] maybe dive deeper into p. 107-108 “theory of roots” and “analysis of the language of action” wrt memes themselves
* [for classifying.md] link beginning of summary to Ranganathan’s faceted classification
* [for classifying.md] go back later to deep dive on “Continuity and Catastrophe” (Foucault, 1970, pp. 145-150), to better grasp and translate the point Foucault’s making about disruption/discontinuity within natural history, in order to better draw comparison with Kuhn in “Classifying the Ages” section
* [for exchange.md] KEY TASK: create my own version of his overall table of Classical -> Modern transition from p. 201
* [for exchange.md] revisit pp. 200-211 to better summarize the overall conclusion to Pt. 1 here
* Create acknowledgements.md and add this: Dedicated to Nance Yanoshak (https://simons-rock.edu/academics/faculty-bios/social-studies-faculty/nance-yanoshak.php), who introduced me both to Michel Foucault and to passionate, creative scholarship.
* Create Foucault episteme image for library paper: What does Foucault mean by ‘episteme’?
“In any given culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in a theory or silently invested in a practice.” (p. 168)
* create "This Is Also Not a Pipe" image
