“Because the mind analyses, the sign appears. Because the mind [has signs at its disposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signified_and_signifier), analysis never ceases” (Foucault, 1970, p. 61)

'Sense-making' gains a longitudinal and more systemic dimension leading onward from the Classical age- instead of always “drawing things together” from face value, we begin to “discriminate” based upon rudimentary frameworks of order- *pure analogy* gives way to *gradual analysis* (Foucault, 1970, p. 55)

“In its perfect state, the system of signs is that simple, absolutely transparent language which is capable of naming what is elementary; it is also that complex of operations which defines all possible conjunctions” (Foucault, 1970, p. 62) - in other words, language moves towards being not just a flat field of signs, but the rulesets that are affiliated with them, such as grammar. 

We can think of this 'next level' of languaged communication, in which it becomes formalized and requires a more participatory social layer, to parallel software code- it is both a set of instructions, and the means by which to execute those instructions.  *this idea will become crucial when turning our focus to the new age of self-referential meaning in meme culture*
